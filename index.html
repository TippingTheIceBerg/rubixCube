            <li>First, you want to start at white center, and make a white cross</li>
            <li>Now we want to focus on the edges, this can be done by aligning the missing white piece to the missing corner, and making sure the colors with the white match the corner of the side.</li>
            <li>The only move you have to focus on is the right move.</li>
            <li>the right move is go up, left, down, right, and only holding onto the right column and moving that accordingly </li>
            <li>With the white side made, we can now flip the cube to the opposite side, in most cases this will be the yellow side.</li>
            <li>With the yellow side we now want to focus on completing the middle section.</li>
            <li>Middle section is by finding a center piece that doesn't have yellow, and matching the center color of the none yellow.</li>
            <li>Now, depending on where the non center non yellow is, will decide which hand move to make</li>
            <li>No matter the choice, if we want the color to move right, well will first move the top piece left, and vice versa. After which, we will now perform the right move, and then the left move, which is up, right, down left, but we will turn the cube with our second movement, facing a full face turn of the opposite desire.</li>
            <li>Once the second layer is done, we will focus on the yellow cross.</li>
            <li>We are now focusing on finding edges, if no edges, turn the front of the cube, the one closest to your body clockwise, then do a right hand move, and then turn the face counter clockwise to undo the clockwise turn. Once we get a line, we want that yellow line to be horizontal, perform the move again.</li>
            <li>Now line up the center pieces you can, and if all four are done, then we can skip the finding step.</li>
            <li>If only two are solved, we want to hold the solves one to the right, and the other one to the back.</li>
            <li>Right column up, top row to the left, now move the right column back down, and move the top one another one to the left. Right column up, move the top one right twice.</li>
            <li>Now match the corners at the top, if one side is all correct, have that right side as the top right square. Turn the top to the left, right column up, top to the right, left column up. Top left, right column down, top to the right, left column down.</li>
            <li>Now, once they are all in the right area, not necessary faced the right way, we will now turn the cube back to the white side up. Now pick a corner that's right, and do the right hand turns.</li>
            <li>Once the color is right, you want to turn the bottom to the right once, and solve that one, note the solved color is not the color of the face you are working on, cause you are never turning the cube to a new face at this point, you are solving for the color face of the other sides while facing the different color. You know when it's complete when the yellow matches the bottom of the cube.</li>
